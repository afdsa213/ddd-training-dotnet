Feature: Issuing certificates
That's the main goal of our system - to be able to issue certificate to the final customers.

Scenario: Issuing certificate process started
Examples
	1. When certificate exam is passed, the issue process starts and certificate is send to the approval team
	2. When certificate exam is not passed, the certificate is not issued and customer is simply notified and nothing important happens (*really?)
	3. When certificate exam is not taken, the exam can be retaken if customer can justify her absence

Scenario: Approval process
Examples
	1. If exam result is verified, the team approves the certificate
	2. If team suspects there could be cheating involved, the certificate is hold until the end of the verification
	3. If team initially suspected cheating could be involed but cannot verify this under 30 days, the certificate is simply approved

Scenario: Shipping certificate
Examples
	1. If certificate is approved, the certificate is signed and send to the customer
